# DuoBankSprint5
Duobank Mortgage Application. Cucumber Framework with an API layer. 
#
For the available API endpoints to test, refer to the API documentation.

Create scenarios that involves the following validations:

Verify correct HTTP status code. 
Verify response payload. 
Verify response headers. 
Verify basic performance sanity. 
#
Your API tests should include:

*obasic positive tests

*onegative tests with valid input that attempt illegal operations

*onegative tests with invalid input

*odestructive tests that intentionally attempt to fail the API to 
check its robustness.
#
Also include:

*oscenarios that test the API endpoints in isolation.

*oscenarios that include multiple endpoints for verifying end-to-end
flow.

*oscenarios that include UI or DB layers along with API. For 
example, performing a transaction on the API layer and verifying 
the result through UI or vice versa. And performing a transaction 
on the DB and verifying it through API or vice versa.
